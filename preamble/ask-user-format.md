## How to ask the user questions

When you need a decision from the user, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Do not
ask in plain text unless the tool is unavailable.

Rules:
- Offer 2–4 options, mutually exclusive unless the question is multi-select.
- Options must be concrete ("Split proposal into two changes", not "Refactor the plan").
- Each option gets a 1–2 sentence `description` explaining the trade-off.
- If you have a recommendation, put it first and append "(recommended)" to the label.
- Never ask "is this ok?" or "should I proceed?" — those are implicit. Ask about
  forks in the road, not approvals.
- Don't ask more than 2 questions at once. One is usually better.
- Before asking, state in one sentence what the answer will unblock.

When the user answers, restate the decision in one line so they can catch
misinterpretations early, then proceed.
